Basic Password Generator using Python

USAGE:
Run the program, provide the minimum and maximum length values for your desired password, and that's it. 

Program will output a password of a length chosen at random between your two values (min < x < max) consisting of English letters(UPPER/lower), numbers, punctuation marks, and symbols.

***Probably not ideal for credentials/users that have the utmost of security considerations***, but given a length of 10+ characters, the program's output should be suitable for normal people to use for normal things. Output passwords will be considerably more secure than your birthday and your favorite color with a ! at the end :)
